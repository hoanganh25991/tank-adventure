# Health Bar Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the health bar system to show health bars for all tanks (main and mini) from initialization, instead of only showing them when tanks take damage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Tank.draw() method
**File:** `js/player.js` (lines 132-133)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Health bar (for mini tanks)
if (this.type === 'mini' && this.health < this.maxHealth) {
    this.drawHealthBar(ctx);
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Health bar (for all tanks)
this.drawHealthBar(ctx);
```

### 2. Enhanced drawHealthBar() method
**File:** `js/player.js` (lines 182-211)

**New Features:**
- **Different sizes**: Main tank has larger health bar (2.5x size vs 2x size, 6px height vs 4px height)
- **Different colors**: Main tank uses blue health bar, mini tanks use green
- **Better positioning**: Main tank health bar positioned higher (-15px vs -10px)
- **Enhanced styling**: Added black background and white border for better visibility
- **Always visible**: Health bars show from initialization regardless of current health

## Visual Design

### Main Tank Health Bar
- Width: 2.5x tank size
- Height: 6px
- Color: Blue (`rgba(0, 180, 255, 0.9)`)
- Position: 15px above tank
- Border: White outline

### Mini Tank Health Bar
- Width: 2x tank size  
- Height: 4px
- Color: Green (`rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.9)`)
- Position: 10px above tank
- Border: White outline

## Benefits

1. **Better player awareness**: Players can immediately see all tank health status
2. **Improved feedback**: No need to wait for damage to see health bars
3. **Enhanced UI**: Cleaner, more consistent visual design
4. **Better gameplay**: Players can make informed decisions about tank positioning

## Implementation Details

The health bar drawing logic now:
1. Always renders regardless of current health
2. Uses different visual styles for main vs mini tanks
3. Provides clear visual hierarchy (main tank is more prominent)
4. Maintains smooth rendering performance

## Testing

- Health bars appear immediately when game starts
- Main tank has distinctive blue health bar
- Mini tanks have green health bars
- All bars update correctly as health changes
- Visual styling is consistent and readable
