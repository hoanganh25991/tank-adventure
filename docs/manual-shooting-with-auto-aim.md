### Core Features Implemented:

1. **Manual Shooting Control**

   - No more automatic continuous shooting for main tank
   - Player has full control over when to engage

2. **Smart Auto-Aim**

   - Calculates distance to all alive enemies
   - Selects closest target and aims precisely
   - Fallback to manual direction if no enemies present

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Red pulsing targeting reticle appears on nearest enemy
   - Corner brackets indicate which enemy will be targeted
   - Clear visual confirmation of auto-aim selection

4. **Mini Tank Independence**

## How to Use:

2. **Press Shoot Button** (bottom-right) when ready to fire
3. **Watch** the red targeting reticle highlight nearest enemy
4. **Main tank** automatically aims and fires at highlighted target
5. **Mini tanks** continue providing support fire automatically

## Technical Implementation:

```javascript
// Auto-aim logic in Player.manualShoot()
if (this.autoAimEnabled && enemies.length > 0) {
    const nearestEnemy = this.findNearestEnemy(enemies);
    if (nearestEnemy) {
        this.mainTank.shoot(nearestEnemy.x, nearestEnemy.y);
        return;
    }
}
```

## Visual Indicators:

- **Red Pulsing Reticle**: Shows which enemy is targeted
- **Corner Brackets**: Classic targeting system appearance
- **Animated Opacity**: Smooth pulsing effect for visibility

## Benefits:

- **Reduced Micro-Management**: No need for precise aiming
- **Maintained Control**: You decide when to shoot
- **Clear Feedback**: Always know what you're targeting
