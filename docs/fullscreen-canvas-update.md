# Fullscreen Canvas Update Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of automatic canvas updating when the game enters or exits fullscreen mode. The system ensures that the canvas properly resizes, maintains crisp rendering, and updates the camera position to provide a seamless fullscreen experience.

## Key Components

### 1. Fullscreen Event Handlers (`setupFullscreenHandlers()`)

The game engine listens for various fullscreen change events across different browsers:

```javascript
const fullscreenEvents = [
    'fullscreenchange',
    'webkitfullscreenchange',
    'mozfullscreenchange',
    'MSFullscreenChange'
];
```

Each event is debounced to prevent multiple rapid calls and includes:
- Canvas size adjustment via `ui.adjustCanvasSize()`
- UI updates via `handleFullscreenChange()`
- Player position validation to prevent off-screen issues

### 2. Canvas Size Adjustment (`adjustCanvasSize()`)

Located in `ui.js`, this method:
- Calculates the proper canvas dimensions based on container size
- Applies device pixel ratio for crisp rendering on high-DPI displays
- Scales the canvas context appropriately
- Maintains crisp rendering settings

### 3. Fullscreen-Specific Canvas Updates (`updateCanvasForFullscreen()`)

A dedicated method that:
- Re-establishes crisp rendering context
- Updates camera positioning for the new screen dimensions
- Forces immediate camera centering on the player
- Triggers a render to ensure visual consistency

### 4. Camera System Updates

The camera system is automatically updated during fullscreen transitions:
- Recalculates target position based on new canvas dimensions
- Immediately snaps to the correct position (no smooth transition)
- Maintains the current zoom level
- Ensures the player remains centered

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Fullscreen Change Handler

```javascript
handleFullscreenChange(isFullscreen) {
    // Update body class for CSS styling
    if (isFullscreen) {
        document.body.classList.add('fullscreen');
    } else {
        document.body.classList.remove('fullscreen');
    }
    
    // Force canvas context re-setup with delay
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.updateCanvasForFullscreen();
    }, 100);
    
    console.log(`Game is now in ${isFullscreen ? 'fullscreen' : 'windowed'} mode`);
}
```

### Canvas Update Method

```javascript
updateCanvasForFullscreen() {
    // Re-setup canvas context for crisp rendering
    this.setupContextForCrispRendering();
    
    // Update camera if in battle mode
    if (this.currentScene === 'battle' && this.player && this.player.mainTank) {
        this.updateCamera();
        
        // Force immediate camera update to new dimensions
        const canvasDims = this.getCanvasCSSDimensions();
        this.camera.targetX = this.player.mainTank.x - (canvasDims.width / 2) / this.camera.zoom;
        this.camera.targetY = this.player.mainTank.y - (canvasDims.height / 2) / this.camera.zoom;
        this.camera.x = this.camera.targetX;
        this.camera.y = this.camera.targetY;
    }
    
    // Trigger immediate render
    this.render();
}
```

### Debounced Event Handling

To prevent multiple rapid calls during fullscreen transitions:

```javascript
document.addEventListener(event, Utils.debounce(() => {
    // Fullscreen change logic
}, 100));
```

## Browser Compatibility

The implementation supports all major browsers:
- **Chrome/Edge**: `fullscreenchange`, `requestFullscreen`, `exitFullscreen`
- **Safari**: `webkitfullscreenchange`, `webkitRequestFullscreen`, `webkitExitFullscreen`
- **Firefox**: `mozfullscreenchange`, `mozRequestFullScreen`, `mozCancelFullScreen`
- **IE/Edge Legacy**: `MSFullscreenChange`, `msRequestFullscreen`, `msExitFullscreen`

## Testing

A test file `test-fullscreen.html` is provided to verify:
- Canvas size updates during fullscreen transitions
- Device pixel ratio handling
- Visual consistency
- Manual canvas update functionality

## Usage

The fullscreen canvas update is automatic and requires no additional setup. The system:

1. **Automatically detects** fullscreen changes
2. **Resizes canvas** to match new dimensions
3. **Maintains crisp rendering** across all devices
4. **Updates camera positioning** to keep gameplay centered
5. **Validates player position** to prevent off-screen issues

## Key Benefits

- **Seamless Experience**: No visual glitches during fullscreen transitions
- **Optimal Performance**: Proper canvas sizing prevents unnecessary rendering overhead
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works consistently across all major browsers
- **High-DPI Support**: Maintains crisp rendering on retina displays
- **Automatic Recovery**: Handles edge cases like player position validation

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Player Off-Screen**: Automatically repositions player if they end up outside the new screen bounds
2. **Multiple Events**: Debouncing prevents multiple rapid adjustments
3. **Canvas Context Loss**: Re-establishes all rendering settings after resize
4. **Camera Smoothing**: Disables smooth camera transitions during fullscreen for immediate centering

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Adaptive UI scaling based on screen size
- Fullscreen-specific control layouts
- Performance monitoring during transitions
- Enhanced mobile fullscreen support
