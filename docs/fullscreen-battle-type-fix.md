# Fullscreen Battle Type Selection Fix

## Problem
The original implementation showed the battle type selection dialog immediately when the start battle button was clicked, without waiting for the fullscreen request to complete. This caused issues where:

1. First time fullscreen request would show the dialog
2. User would make a selection
3. Page would refresh due to fullscreen event handling
4. User would have to choose battle type again

## Root Cause
The fullscreen request is asynchronous and can take time to complete, especially on mobile devices. The battle type selection was being shown immediately without waiting for the fullscreen request to succeed.

## Solution
Modified the flow to:

1. **Wait for fullscreen success**: The `requestFullscreenAndShowBattleType()` method now waits for the fullscreen request to complete before showing the battle type selection.

2. **Enhanced promise handling**: Updated `Utils.requestFullscreen()` to properly handle fullscreen events and provide reliable promise resolution.

3. **Loading indicator**: Added a loading overlay to show the user that fullscreen is being requested.

4. **Fallback behavior**: If fullscreen fails, the battle type selection is still shown so the game can continue.

## Technical Implementation

### Flow Diagram
```
User clicks "Start Battle"
    ↓
Check if already in fullscreen
    ↓ No
Show loading indicator
    ↓
Request fullscreen
    ↓
Wait for fullscreen event
    ↓ Success
Hide loading indicator
    ↓
Show battle type selection
    ↓
User selects battle type
    ↓
Start battle
```

### Key Changes

1. **UI.js**: Modified `handleStartBattle()` to call `requestFullscreenAndShowBattleType()`
2. **UI.js**: Added loading indicator methods
3. **Utils.js**: Enhanced `requestFullscreen()` with proper event handling
4. **game-engine.js**: Added flag to prevent duplicate fullscreen requests

## Benefits
- Eliminates the refresh/re-selection issue
- Provides better user feedback with loading indicator
- Handles cross-browser fullscreen API differences
- Maintains fallback behavior for unsupported browsers
