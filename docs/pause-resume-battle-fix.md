# Pause-Resume Battle State Fix

## Problem Description
When pausing a battle using the Settings button and then directly clicking "Exit to menu", followed by starting a new battle, the game would not properly resume. The battlefield would show only a green field without:
- Grid lines
- Player tanks
- Enemy tanks
- Environmental elements

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue occurred because when exiting to menu from a paused state, several game systems were not properly reset:

1. **Camera Position**: Camera remained at the old battle position
2. **Dynamic Environment**: Spawned regions and player tracking were not reset
3. **Player Position**: Reset was using incorrect coordinates (player.x/y instead of player.mainTank.x/y)
4. **Effects System**: Old effects remained active
5. **Environment Initialization**: No environment was spawned around the new player position

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Enhanced `resetBattleState()` Method
```javascript
resetBattleState() {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    // Reset player position to center (fix: use mainTank coordinates)
    if (this.player && this.player.mainTank) {
        const canvasDims = this.getCanvasCSSDimensions();
        this.player.mainTank.x = canvasDims.width / 2;
        this.player.mainTank.y = canvasDims.height / 2;
        
        // Also reset mini tank positions relative to main tank
        this.player.updateMiniTankPositions();
    }
    
    // Reset camera to center on player
    this.resetCamera();
    
    // Reset dynamic environment system
    this.resetDynamicEnvironment();
    
    // Clear all effects
    this.clearAllEffects();
}
```

### 2. Added Helper Methods

#### `resetCamera()`
- Properly centers camera on player position
- Resets zoom to default value (0.7)
- Sets both current and target camera positions

#### `resetDynamicEnvironment()`
- Clears all spawned environment regions
- Resets player tracking variables
- Resets accumulated distance counter

#### `clearAllEffects()`
- Clears explosions, damage numbers, and particles
- Calls SkillEffects.clearAllEffects() to clear skill-related effects

### 3. Enhanced `startBattle()` Method
Added proper initialization sequence:
```javascript
// Update mini tank positions relative to main tank
this.player.updateMiniTankPositions();

// Reset camera to center on player
this.resetCamera();

// Reset dynamic environment system
this.resetDynamicEnvironment();

// Clear all effects from previous battles
this.clearAllEffects();

// Initialize environment around player
this.spawnEnvironmentAroundPlayer(this.player.mainTank.x, this.player.mainTank.y);
```

### 4. Added `clearAllEffects()` to SkillEffects Class
```javascript
clearAllEffects() {
    // Clear all active effects
    this.activeEffects = [];
    
    // Clear screen effects
    this.screenEffects = [];
    
    // Clear shake effects
    this.shakeEffects = [];
    
    console.log('All skill effects cleared');
}
```

## Files Modified
- `js/game-engine.js`: Enhanced battle state management
- `js/skill-effects.js`: Added clearAllEffects method

## Testing Steps
1. Start a battle
2. Pause the game using Settings button
3. Click "Exit to menu"
4. Start a new battle
5. Verify that grid, tanks, and enemies are all visible

## Expected Result
After the fix, when resuming from a paused state and starting a new battle:
- Grid lines are properly rendered
- Player tanks are visible and positioned correctly
- Enemy tanks spawn and are visible
- Environmental elements (rocks, flowers, etc.) are rendered
- Camera is properly centered on the player
- All game systems function normally

## Technical Notes
- The fix ensures proper cleanup and reinitialization of all game systems
- Camera positioning uses CSS canvas dimensions for consistency
- Dynamic environment system is fully reset to prevent memory leaks
- All visual effects are cleared to prevent interference
