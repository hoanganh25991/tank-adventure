# Health Regeneration System

## Overview
The health regeneration system automatically restores all tanks (main tank and mini tanks) to 100% health after completing each wave. This feature ensures that players can continue battling through multiple waves without being permanently weakened by damage taken in previous waves.

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality
- **Full Health Restoration**: All tanks are restored to their maximum health (100%)
- **Revival System**: Destroyed tanks are brought back to life with full health
- **Automatic Trigger**: Regeneration occurs automatically when transitioning between waves
- **Visual Feedback**: Players receive a notification when health regeneration occurs

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. GameEngine Methods Modified
- `continueToNextWave()`: Added health regeneration before starting the next wave
- `resumeBattle()`: Added health regeneration for battle resumption scenarios

#### 2. New Method Added
```javascript
regenerateAllTanksHealth() {
    if (!this.player) return;
    
    console.log('Regenerating health for all tanks to 100%');
    
    // Regenerate main tank health to 100%
    this.player.mainTank.health = this.player.mainTank.maxHealth;
    this.player.mainTank.isAlive = true;
    
    // Regenerate all mini tanks health to 100%
    for (const miniTank of this.player.miniTanks) {
        miniTank.health = miniTank.maxHealth;
        miniTank.isAlive = true;
    }
    
    // Show a visual notification to the player
    if (this.ui) {
        this.ui.showNotification('ðŸ’š All Tanks Fully Healed!', 'success');
    }
}
```

```

### Benefits

#### 1. **Strategic Gameplay**
- Players can take calculated risks during waves
- Encourages aggressive play styles
- Reduces frustration from accumulated damage

#### 2. **Balanced Progression**
- Each wave starts with full strength
- Difficulty scaling remains consistent
- Players can focus on skill selection rather than health management

#### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Clear visual feedback with notifications
- Consistent game state between waves
- Reduced need for defensive play

### Testing

#### Manual Testing
A comprehensive test file has been created at `tests/test-health-regeneration.html` that allows:
- Creating test players with tanks
- Simulating damage to random tanks
- Testing the regeneration functionality
- Visual health bar representation
- Detailed logging of all operations

#### Test Scenarios
1. **Partial Damage**: Tanks with reduced health are restored to full
2. **Tank Destruction**: Destroyed tanks are revived with full health
3. **Mixed States**: Some tanks damaged, some destroyed, some healthy
4. **Edge Cases**: No player, no tanks, maximum damage scenarios

### Configuration

#### Health Values
- **Main Tank**: Starts with 300 max health, upgradeable
- **Mini Tanks**: Start with 100 max health each, upgradeable
- **Regeneration**: Always restores to current maximum health (including upgrades)

#### Timing
- **Trigger Point**: Between wave completion and next wave start
- **Duration**: Instantaneous restoration
- **Frequency**: Once per wave transition

### Future Enhancements

#### Potential Improvements
1. **Partial Regeneration**: Option for 50% or 75% health restoration
2. **Skill-Based Regeneration**: Skills that affect regeneration amount
3. **Animation Effects**: Visual healing effects during regeneration
4. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for health restoration
5. **Difficulty Scaling**: Reduced regeneration on higher difficulties

#### Configuration Options
```javascript
// Potential future configuration
const REGENERATION_CONFIG = {
    enabled: true,
    percentage: 100, // 100% = full health
    reviveDestroyedTanks: true,
    showNotification: true,
    animationDuration: 1000 // milliseconds
};
```

### Code Locations

#### Files Modified
- `js/game-engine.js`: Added regeneration logic and method calls
- `tests/test-health-regeneration.html`: Created comprehensive test suite

#### Key Methods
- `GameEngine.regenerateAllTanksHealth()`: Core regeneration logic
- `GameEngine.continueToNextWave()`: Wave transition with regeneration
- `GameEngine.resumeBattle()`: Battle resumption with regeneration

### Performance Impact

#### Minimal Overhead
- Simple property assignments
- No complex calculations
- Executes only during wave transitions
- No impact on battle performance

#### Memory Usage
- No additional memory allocation
- Uses existing tank objects
- Minimal notification system usage

## Conclusion

The health regeneration system provides a balanced and user-friendly approach to multi-wave battles. It ensures that players can enjoy the full challenge of each wave without being penalized by damage from previous encounters, while maintaining the strategic elements of individual wave combat.
