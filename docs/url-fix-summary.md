# URL Double Slash Fix Summary

## Problem
The Android build was generating URLs with double slashes like:
`https://hoanganh25991.github.io//tank-adventure`

This caused 404 errors because the correct URL should be:
`https://hoanganh25991.github.io/tank-adventure`

## Root Cause
The issue was in `manifest.json` where paths were defined with leading slashes:
- `"id": "/tank-adventure/"` 
- `"start_url": "/tank-adventure/"`
- `"scope": "/tank-adventure/"`

When Bubblewrap combined these with the base URL, it created double slashes.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed manifest.json paths
Changed from absolute paths to relative paths:
```json
{
  "id": "./",
  "start_url": "./",
  "scope": "./",
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "url": "./?action=quick-battle"
    },
    {
      "url": "./?action=base"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Updated build-android.sh
- Added proper URL validation
- Created separate `MANIFEST_URL` variable
- Added URL validation to prevent double slashes
- Shows URLs during build process for verification

## Result
- No more double slash URLs
- Clean URLs like `https://hoanganh25991.github.io/tank-adventure`
- Proper manifest resolution
- Better error handling and validation

## Files Modified
- `manifest.json` - Fixed URL paths
- `build-android.sh` - Added URL validation and proper manifest URL construction
