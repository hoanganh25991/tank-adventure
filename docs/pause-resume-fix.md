# Pause/Resume Bug Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking the "settings" button in battle, the game would pause but pressing "resume" would not actually resume the game. The tank could not be controlled anymore.

## Root Cause
The `handleInput()` method in `game-engine.js` was not checking if the game was paused before processing input. This meant that:

1. When the game was paused, the `gamePaused` flag was set to `true`
2. The game update loop would stop updating battle logic
3. BUT input was still being processed, causing conflicting states
4. When resuming, the input system was in an inconsistent state

## Fix Applied
Added a pause check to the `handleInput()` method:

```javascript
// Before:
handleInput() {
    if (this.currentScene !== 'battle' || !this.player || !this.ui) return;

// After:
handleInput() {
    if (this.currentScene !== 'battle' || !this.player || !this.ui || this.gamePaused) return;
```

## Testing Steps
1. Start the game
2. Enter battle mode
3. Click the settings button (⚙️) in the top-right during battle
4. Verify the pause modal appears
5. Click "Resume" button
6. Verify the tank can be controlled again with the joystick

## Flow Diagram
```
Battle Active → Click Settings → Game Paused → Input Disabled
                    ↓
Pause Modal → Click Resume → Game Resumed → Input Enabled
```

## Files Modified
- `js/game-engine.js`: Added `|| this.gamePaused` check to handleInput()

## Status
✅ Fixed and tested
