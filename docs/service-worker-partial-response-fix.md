# Service Worker Partial Response Fix

## Problem
The service worker was throwing an error when trying to cache partial responses (HTTP 206):
```
TypeError: Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache': Partial response (status code 206) is unsupported
```

## Root Cause
The Cache API doesn't support caching partial responses (HTTP 206 status codes). These responses are typically generated when:
- A client requests a specific range of bytes from a resource (Range requests)
- A server returns only part of the requested content
- Media files are being streamed or partially downloaded

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive caching strategy that:

1. **Added isCacheable() helper function** to check if a response is suitable for caching
2. **Filters out partial responses** (status 206) and other non-cacheable responses
3. **Added error handling** for cache operations to prevent request failures
4. **Updated both strategies** (network-first and cache-first) to use the new logic

### Key Changes

#### 1. Helper Function
```javascript
function isCacheable(response) {
    // Don't cache partial content (206), redirects, or error responses
    return response.ok && 
           response.status !== 206 && 
           response.status < 300 &&
           response.type !== 'opaque' &&
           response.headers.get('cache-control') !== 'no-cache';
}
```

#### 2. Updated Caching Logic
- Only cache responses that pass the `isCacheable()` check
- Wrap cache operations in try-catch blocks
- Log cache errors as warnings without failing the request
- Return the original response even if caching fails

#### 3. Cache Version Update
- Updated cache version to v1.1.1 to force service worker reload
- Ensures all clients get the fixed version

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. **Always check response status** before caching
2. **Handle cache errors gracefully** to prevent request failures
3. **Use try-catch blocks** around cache operations
4. **Consider response type** and headers when determining cacheability
5. **Test with different types of resources** (images, audio, video, etc.)

## Testing
1. Clear browser cache and service worker
2. Reload the application
3. Monitor console for cache-related errors
4. Test with media files that might trigger range requests

## Benefits
- Prevents service worker crashes
- Maintains functionality for all response types
- Improves offline experience
- Better error handling and logging
