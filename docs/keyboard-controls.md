# Keyboard Controls Implementation

## Overview
Added WASD keyboard controls for tank movement and spacebar for shooting, working alongside the existing mobile touch controls.

## Controls

### Movement
- **W** - Move tank up/north
- **A** - Move tank left/west  
- **S** - Move tank down/south
- **D** - Move tank right/east

### Combat
- **Spacebar** - Shoot (with auto-aim to nearest enemy)

### Debug Controls (Development)
- **C** - Toggle collision boxes display
- **E** - Toggle environment debug info
- **R** - Reset tank rendering log
- **Z** - Zoom out camera
- **X** - Zoom in camera

## Implementation Details

### Key Features
1. **Seamless Integration**: Keyboard controls work alongside existing mobile touch controls
2. **Priority System**: When both keyboard and touch inputs are active, keyboard input takes priority
3. **Normalized Movement**: WASD input is properly normalized for diagonal movement
4. **Auto-aim Shooting**: Spacebar shooting uses the same auto-aim system as mobile controls
5. **Battle-only**: Controls only work during battle scenes, not in menus
6. **Speed Balancing**: Different speed multipliers for optimal control experience

### Technical Implementation

#### Keyboard State Tracking
```javascript
this.keys = {
    w: false,
    a: false, 
    s: false,
    d: false,
    space: false
};
```

#### Input Processing
- `getKeyboardInput()` - Calculates movement direction from WASD keys
- `handleKeyboardShoot()` - Handles spacebar shooting with auto-aim
- `handleInput()` - Combines joystick and keyboard input with speed balancing

#### Speed Multipliers
- **Keyboard Controls**: 0.2x speed (5x slower) for precise movement
- **Joystick Controls**: 0.5x speed (2x slower) for balanced mobile experience
- Speed multipliers are applied in the movement calculation to maintain responsive but controlled movement

#### Event Handling
- `keydown` events set key states to true
- `keyup` events set key states to false
- `preventDefault()` prevents browser scrolling on WASD keys

## Usage
1. Start the game and begin a battle
2. Use WASD keys to move your tank and formation
3. Press spacebar to shoot at enemies
4. Touch controls remain fully functional for mobile users

## Compatibility
- Works on desktop browsers with keyboard support
- Does not interfere with mobile touch controls
- Maintains all existing mobile functionality
