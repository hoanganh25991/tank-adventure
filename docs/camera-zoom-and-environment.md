# Camera Zoom and Environment Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Tank Adventure game with improved camera system, environmental elements, and balanced shooting mechanics to create a more engaging and strategic battlefield experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Camera Zoom System
- **Default zoom level**: 0.7x (zoomed out to see more of the battlefield)
- **Smooth zoom transitions**: Gradual zoom changes for better visual experience
- **Dynamic zoom controls**: 
  - Press `Z` to zoom out (minimum 0.3x)
  - Press `X` to zoom in (maximum 1.5x)
- **Proper coordinate transformations**: All rendering elements correctly scaled

### 2. Reduced Shooting Ranges
Forces more tactical movement and closer combat engagement:

#### Player Tanks
- **Bullet lifetime**: Reduced from 2000ms to 1000ms
- **Effective range**: ~50% reduction

#### Enemy Tanks
- **Basic enemies**: Range reduced from 200 to 120 units
- **Heavy enemies**: Range reduced from 250 to 140 units  
- **Fast enemies**: Range reduced from 150 to 100 units
- **Sniper enemies**: Range reduced from 350 to 180 units
- **Boss enemies**: Range reduced from 300 to 160 units
- **Bullet lifetime**: Reduced from 3000ms to 1500ms

### 3. Environmental Elements
Added procedurally generated environment for visual interest and tactical depth:

#### Rocks/Obstacles (15% spawn rate)
- **Appearance**: Gray rectangular rocks with varied sizes
- **Size range**: 15-35 units
- **Spacing**: Every 200 units in grid pattern
- **Purpose**: Visual interest and potential cover

#### Trees/Vegetation (20% spawn rate)
- **Appearance**: Green circular foliage with brown trunk
- **Size range**: 20-35 units
- **Spacing**: Every 150 units in grid pattern
- **Purpose**: Natural battlefield aesthetics

#### Water/Ponds (8% spawn rate)
- **Appearance**: Blue-green circular ponds
- **Size range**: 30-55 units
- **Spacing**: Every 300 units in grid pattern
- **Purpose**: Terrain variation and visual appeal

### 4. Deterministic Generation
- **Consistent placement**: Environment elements appear in same locations each time
- **Performance optimized**: Only renders elements within camera view
- **Seed-based**: Uses position-based mathematical seeding for variety

## Technical Implementation

### Camera System
```javascript
// Camera with zoom support
this.camera = {
    x: 0, y: 0,
    targetX: 0, targetY: 0,
    smoothing: 0.1,
    zoom: 0.7,
    targetZoom: 0.7,
    zoomSmoothing: 0.05
};
```

### Rendering Pipeline
```javascript
// Apply zoom and camera transform
this.ctx.scale(this.camera.zoom, this.camera.zoom);
this.ctx.translate(-this.camera.x, -this.camera.y);
```

### Environment Drawing
```javascript
// Deterministic placement using position-based seeding
const seed = (x * 31 + y * 17) % 100;
if (seed > 85) { // 15% chance for obstacles
    // Generate obstacle at calculated position
}
```

## Gameplay Impact

### Strategic Benefits
1. **Increased visibility**: Players can see more enemies and plan movements
2. **Tactical positioning**: Shorter ranges require strategic positioning
3. **Active engagement**: Players must move to stay in effective range
4. **Environmental awareness**: Varied terrain creates visual landmarks

### Balance Changes
- **Movement importance**: Increased emphasis on positioning
- **Engagement distance**: Closer combat encounters
- **Survivability**: More opportunities to avoid long-range camping
- **Visual feedback**: Better spatial awareness of battlefield

## Controls

### Debug Keys (During Battle)
- `C`: Toggle collision boxes
- `D`: Toggle debug mode
- `R`: Reset tank rendering log
- `Z`: Zoom out (minimum 0.3x)
- `X`: Zoom in (maximum 1.5x)

## Performance Considerations
- **Viewport culling**: Only renders environment elements within camera view
- **Deterministic generation**: No random number generation during gameplay
- **Optimized rendering**: Efficient drawing loops with early exit conditions

## Future Enhancements
- **Collision detection**: Environment elements could block movement/bullets
- **Interactive elements**: Destructible environment
- **Dynamic weather**: Fog, rain effects
- **Terrain types**: Different battlefield themes
