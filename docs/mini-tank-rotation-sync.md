# Mini Tank Rotation Synchronization

## Overview
This enhancement updates the mini tank behavior to rotate in the same direction as the main tank when moving with the joystick. This creates a more cohesive formation and visual experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `updateMiniTankFormation()` Method
- **File**: `js/player.js`
- **Lines**: 320-345

#### Previous Behavior:
- Mini tanks only followed the main tank's position
- They maintained their original orientation regardless of main tank direction
- Formation was static relative to world coordinates

#### New Behavior:
- Mini tanks rotate to match the main tank's direction
- Formation rotates dynamically based on main tank's facing direction
- All tanks face the same direction as the main tank

### 2. Added `rotateFormationPosition()` Method
- **File**: `js/player.js`
- **Lines**: 348-357

#### Purpose:
- Calculates rotated formation positions relative to main tank's direction
- Uses trigonometric rotation to maintain proper formation spacing
- Ensures mini tanks maintain their relative positions while rotating

## Technical Implementation

### Formation Rotation Logic
```javascript
// Calculate rotated formation position relative to main tank's direction
const rotatedPos = this.rotateFormationPosition(basePos, mainTank.targetAngle);
const targetX = mainTank.x + rotatedPos.x;
const targetY = mainTank.y + rotatedPos.y;
```

### Rotation Synchronization
```javascript
// Sync rotation with main tank
miniTank.targetAngle = mainTank.targetAngle;
```

## Visual Result

### Before:
```
    ↑ MT     ← Formation faces different directions
   ↓ ← → ↑   ← Mini tanks maintain original orientation
    ↓
```

### After:
```
    ↑ MT     ← All tanks face same direction
   ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑   ← Mini tanks rotate with main tank
    ↑
```

## Testing

### How to Test:
1. Load the game and start a battle
2. Use the joystick to move the tank in different directions
3. Observe that all mini tanks rotate to face the same direction as the main tank
4. Verify that the formation maintains proper spacing while rotating

### Expected Results:
- All tanks face the movement direction
- Formation rotates as a unit
- Smooth rotation transitions
- Proper spacing maintained

## Benefits

1. **Visual Cohesion**: All tanks appear as a unified formation
2. **Intuitive Movement**: Direction of movement matches tank orientation
3. **Better Gameplay**: Formation looks more professional and coordinated
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All tanks respond to joystick input uniformly

## Compatibility

- Works with existing joystick controls
- Maintains smooth movement and rotation
- Compatible with all device types (mobile, desktop)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

- Add optional formation patterns (V-formation, diamond, etc.)
- Implement different rotation speeds for variety
- Add formation tightness controls
- Consider independent mini tank aiming while maintaining movement sync
