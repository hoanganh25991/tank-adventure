# Joystick Control Testing Guide

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Direction Control
- **Test**: Move joystick in all 8 directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- **Expected**: Tank should move smoothly in the exact direction of joystick
- **Verify**: Movement should be consistent and responsive

### 2. Variable Speed Control
- **Test**: Push joystick slightly from center, then gradually increase to full extent
- **Expected**: Tank speed should increase gradually with joystick distance from center
- **Verify**: No sudden speed jumps, smooth acceleration

### 3. Immediate Stop Response
- **Test**: Move tank in any direction, then quickly release joystick
- **Expected**: Tank should stop immediately with smooth deceleration
- **Verify**: No "drift" or continued movement after release

### 4. Deadzone Handling
- **Test**: Make very small movements with joystick near center
- **Expected**: Tank should not move for tiny joystick movements (within 15% of center)
- **Verify**: Prevents accidental movement from finger tremor

### 5. Multi-Touch Compatibility
- **Test**: While controlling joystick, tap other UI elements (shoot button, skill buttons)
- **Expected**: Joystick control should continue working normally
- **Verify**: No interference between joystick and other touch controls

### 6. Smooth Mini-Tank Formation
- **Test**: Move main tank in various directions and patterns
- **Expected**: Mini tanks should follow in formation smoothly
- **Verify**: No jerky movement, consistent formation spacing

### 7. Delta-Time Consistency
- **Test**: Move tank during different frame rates (if possible)
- **Expected**: Movement speed should remain consistent regardless of FPS
- **Verify**: Tank moves same distance per second regardless of performance

## Performance Metrics

### Responsiveness Targets
- **Touch to Movement**: < 16ms (1 frame at 60fps)
- **Release to Stop**: < 100ms (smooth deceleration)
- **Direction Change**: Immediate response

### Smoothness Indicators
- **No Stuttering**: Movement should be fluid
- **No Overshooting**: Tank should not go past intended direction
- **Consistent Speed**: Same joystick position = same speed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Jerky Movement
- **Check**: Verify delta-time is being used correctly
- **Solution**: Ensure movement calculation uses `deltaTime / 1000`

### Issue: Tank Won't Stop
- **Check**: Verify `moveIntensity` is properly reset to 0
- **Solution**: Check `resetStick()` method and touch event handling

### Issue: Delayed Response
- **Check**: Touch events might be conflicting
- **Solution**: Verify touch ID tracking and event listeners

### Issue: Inconsistent Speed
- **Check**: Frame rate dependencies
- **Solution**: Ensure velocity-based movement with proper time scaling
