#### Core Business Logic

Game focus on mobile and tablet with touch screen.

1. **Player and Mini Tanks:**
   - The player controls a large tank, surrounded by five mini tanks.
   - Movement is synchronized and controlled via a virutal joystick on mobile screen on the bottom-left.
   - Player touch to skill buttons and primary shoot button on the bottom-right.

2. **Battle Mechanics:**
   - Engage in battles against auto-deployed enemy troops.
   - Enemies appear in increasing waves, growing stronger with each level.
   - After each wave, players choose from skill options (active/passive) to enhance their capabilities.
   - Skills reset periodically during battles.
   - Each battle can have 3-10 waves, we just design that to increase difficulty over time.

3. **Progression and Upgrades:**
   - Battle results are summarized, with levels awarded based on performance.
   - Post-battle, players access a base screen to upgrade tanks and mini tanks.
   - A business system supports various upgrade paths.

4. **Skill Management:**
   - Active skills are auto-cast; players focus on movement control.
